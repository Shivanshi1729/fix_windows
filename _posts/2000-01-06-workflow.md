1. Create four desktops
2. Install this script
   - [https://github.com/pmb6tz/windows-desktop-switcher](https://github.com/pmb6tz/windows-desktop-switcher) or
   - [Download it as zip](https://github.com/pmb6tz/windows-desktop-switcher/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
     and extract it.
3. Inside it there is a file called `user_config.ahk`, remove everything inside it and add these

```ahk
; for switching desktops
#1::switchDesktopByNumber(1)
#2::switchDesktopByNumber(2)
#3::switchDesktopByNumber(3)
#4::switchDesktopByNumber(4)
; for moving windows between desktops
#+1::MoveCurrentWindowToDesktop(1)
#+2::MoveCurrentWindowToDesktop(2)
#+3::MoveCurrentWindowToDesktop(3)
#+4::MoveCurrentWindowToDesktop(4)
; switch desktop to last opened
#`::switchDesktopToLastOpened()
```

This will add following shortcuts

- `Start` + `1` - Switch to desktop 1
- `Start` + `2` - Switch to desktop 2
- `Start` + `3` - Switch to desktop 3
- `Start` + `4` - Switch to desktop 4
- `Start` + `Shift` + `1` - Switch to desktop 1
- `Start` + `Shift` + `2` - Switch to desktop 2
- `Start` + `Shift` + `3` - Switch to desktop 3
- `Start` + `Shift` + `4` - Switch to desktop 4
- `Start` + ` - Switch to last opened desktop

Put the `desktop_switcher.ahk` on the startup.
